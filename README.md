This repository contains the solutions implemented during my self-study of C++ during the summer of 2018. The book referenced is Absolute C++,
Fifth Edition by Walter Savitch. My code is not optimized nor does it implement Exception Handling since that is one of the last chapters 
in this book. I am well aware that some of the problems are referenced by the Problem Solving with C++ companion book, as well as
Absolute Java.

It is my hope that the code provides some help rather than a full-fledged solution! The last time I took a C++ course was in the fall of 2014
and I was completely lost, but now with practice and maturity many of the concepts are slowly making sense. So please don't give up,
it is the problem solving that is truly the skill here...although it may be difficult to see at times.
