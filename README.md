Based on Qt 5.8.0 (MSVC 2015, 32 bit) MinGW Compiler

This repository contains the solutions implemented during my self-study of C++ during the summer of 2018. The book referenced is Absolute C++,
Fifth Edition by Walter Savitch. My code is not optimized nor does it implement Exception Handling since that is one of the last chapters 
in this book. I am well aware that some of the problems are referenced by the Problem Solving with C++ companion book, as well as
Absolute Java.
